# Simple Encryption Algorithm

### Summary
Here I made a simple encryption algorithm I made using ASCII values while I was learning symmetric-key encryption in school. It uses the ASCII values and increments them to create encrypted data. The same integer value is used to encrypt and decrypt the data so it is symmetric encryption. It might be fun to generate some cool passwords using this algorithm.
